                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the US?</strong>
                                                                    <br> When I first left to study in the United States I didn't notice any changes. It wasn't until I started studying in China and in Japan that I noticed just how much my global perspective was influenced from studying in America. In many areas, politics, ethics, social manners--I had only been look at them through an American perspective, leaving behind even some of the social norms I was brought up with in Europe. Studying in Europe, America, Asia, really anywhere different, has been invaluable to me. When I'm struggling with a problem that I have mental restrictions about and find difficult to solve, due to the environment I was brought up in, I can pull from my experiences in the US and see how a different group of people would solve the problem I'm facing. It is for this reason I'd highly recommend to everyone to study abroad: it's not just about learning a new culture and language—it’s about learning how to problem solve for life’s problems.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite spot on campus?</strong>
                                                                    <br> The library! It's a great place to read (THERE ARE REALLY COOL BOOKS), relax, and study. Recently, I've taken out copies of Isaac Newton's Principia and Optics to read for my enjoyment.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is a fun place you have visited in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br> The beach is great! Lake beaches are a nice compromise between pools and oceans. They’re very relaxing.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What was your favorite class at CWRU, and why?</strong>
                                                                    <br> Computer science because it’s full of puzzles!</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What would you like to do after you have completed your educational experience at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br> I would like to continue into graduate school. Most preferably, I would like to end up in physics research.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice would you give to students arriving to study at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br> Be absolutely 400% proactive in everything! College is a place with unlimited resources and your potential to do great things is exponentially increased with just a wee bit of networking. Furthermore, the more new things you try and uncomfortable situations you put yourself in, the quicker and more you'll learn, and you'll be ready to deal with any uncomfortable situation. Never be afraid to realize your goals just because it means talking to a few hundred people.  If you fail, there are always a few hundred more people there to help you and guide you along the path to your dreams.</p>
